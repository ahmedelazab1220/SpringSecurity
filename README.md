Welcome, everyone! In this repository, I aim to cover all essential aspects of Spring Security comprehensively. But before diving into that, let's lay down some foundational concepts.

Let's start by understanding the differences between encoding, encryption, hash functions and other basics that you should know before starting, which are essential to understanding the basics. It is not necessary to explore these concepts in detail. Let's start.

## Chapter 1.
   
### Agenda 
   - **Cryptography**
   - **Http Request and Response**
   - **Authentication and Authorization**

### Cryptography.
##### Cryptography is a science of cryptography that was used in the past in wars to send messages to each other , so that if they fell into the hands the enemy. he would not be able to interpret or read them. This is the method currently used. There are three important types in the world `encoding` , `encryption` , `hashing`.

- 1. encoding 
  Converting information into a different format or representation, often in a compressed or symbolic manner, typically to facilitate storage, transmission, or processing.
  From the output you can get the input.

- 2. encryption
  Securing data through transformation into an unreadable format, often using algorithms and keys, to prevent unauthorized access or comprehension.
  From the output you can get the input but using key only the two parties know it. Also , it does not have a fixed size and length and has two types (`symmetric` , `asymmetric`).

- 3. hashing
  Hashing transforms input data into a fixed-size output, typically irreversible, used for data integrity verification and password storage.
  From the output you can't get the input , if someone modify or add anything to it , it changes completely.

### Http Request and Response.

Http stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses

- 1. Http request 
     is a fundamental part of web communications, forming the basis of data exchange on the internet. Itâ€™s a protocol used for fetching resources, such as HTML documents, images, and other files, from web servers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

     ![Http Request](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/8080dcb7-2491-451d-8780-8e5fe90e75d6)
     
      - Request Line: An HTTP request starts with a request line, which includes the following:
     
           - Method: This indicates the action to be performed on the resource. Common methods include GET (retrieve a resource), POST (submit data to the server), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource), and others.
           - Request URL (Path): The URL of the resource being requested.
           - HTTP Version: The version of the HTTP protocol being used.
     
      - Request Headers : 
    
          - Following the request line are headers, which provide additional information about the request. This can include details about the clientâ€™s browser, the types of responses that the client will accept, cookies, and more.
    
      - Blank Line : 
    
          - A blank line indicates the end of the headers section.
    
      - Request Body : 
    
          - Request Body (Optional): Not all requests have a body. Bodies are typically included in POST or PUT requests, where youâ€™re sending data to the server (like form inputs or file uploads). The body contains the data being sent.
       ![behind the scene http request](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/94ff6178-7275-469e-b974-97f55374b260)
- 2. Http response
     is what a server sends back to the client after receiving and processing an HTTP request. It is a key part of the data exchange in web communications, essentially being the serverâ€™s answer to the clientâ€™s request. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of
     the components of an HTTP response:

     ![Http Response](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/f0dba1f7-60ac-4d6c-8596-e61449a6194b)

     - Status Line: This is the first line of the response and includes:
     
        - HTTP Version: Indicates the HTTP protocol version used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
        - Status Code: A three-digit number that indicates the outcome of the request. Common status codes include 200 (OK, - request succeeded), 404 (Not Found, the resource canâ€™t be found), 500 (Internal Server Error), etc.
        - Status Text: A brief, human-readable explanation of the status code (e.g., OK, Not Found, Internal Server Error).
    
     - Response Headers: 
     
        - These are key-value pairs providing additional information about the response. They can include details such as the server type, content type, content length, caching policies, set cookies, and other metadata. 
       
     - Blank Line : 

       - A blank line indicates the end of the headers section.   
     
     - Response Body: 
     
       - This part of the response contains the actual data or resource that the client requested. For example, it could be an HTML file, JSON data, an image, etc. In some cases, particularly when the response indicates an error (like a 404), the body might contain a message explaining the error.
       
         ![behind the scene http response](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/5c480d4b-a65d-4780-9bc9-92df63239629)

### Authentication and Authorization.

   1. Authentication
        Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user accessing a system or application.

   2. How Spring Security handles authentication
       Spring Security handles authentication by employing various authentication providers, such as in-memory authentication, JDBC-based authentication, and LDAP authentication. Each provider validates user credentials and establishes the userâ€™s identity within the application.

   3. Authorization
       Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform within an application. It establishes rules and permissions for accessing protected resources based on the userâ€™s identity and assigned roles.

## Chapter 2.

### Agenda 
  - **Intro to Spring Security**
  - **Default Security**

   ![Spring Security](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/a749b647-ac8b-47d5-9fa4-9fb26bb145e4) 
   ###### Spring Security is a powerful and widely used framework that provides a wide range of features for securing Java applications. When combined with Spring Boot, it becomes even easier to implement secure applications quickly and efficiently. In this article, we will explore how to get started with Spring Security. you can clone this repository `https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity.git` or download zip file to understand me better.
   
 
##### By default, the Authentication gets enabled for the Application , you can use any web browser or Postman to test. Spring Security by default generate security password , you can see this in console log when run application and default username is `user`
 
 ![generate password](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/d796241f-53a2-4cc4-a74d-c6fb5a5a2235)
  
  if you don't like default generate you can write in `application.properties` next two lines : 
    - `spring.security.user.name = [your_username]`
    - `spring.security.user.password = [your_password]`
  
  ok let's go on any web browser you used it, and write `http://localhost:8080` will appear this page. this login page spring security create for you as default , then you can set username `user` and password 'this appear in your terminal' to can access 
  
 ![login page](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/827f5070-893f-41a4-873f-20cc9906ff3a)
 
 if you want to log out you can write this `http://localhost:8080/logout`
 
 ![logout page](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/4cb84413-c7ee-4ad5-be5e-018463f5c824)
 
 You can create a Controller and create html page or RestController like in my application , which will direct API requests to the authentication process (login page) first before accessing any other endpoints.

## Chapter 3.

### Agenda 
   - **In-Memory Authentication**
   - **UserDetailsService**
   - **UserDetails**
   - **PasswordEncoder**

#### when you do configuration by this way , you don't need to write anything in `application.properties` because you create users and save in memory and when you run application password security that appear in previous default security not appear now because make all this in application, make sure clone this repository to understand me better and let's talk about this class.

![Security Configuration1](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/2e2baeca-1d03-4e27-94ac-4c17760860a6)


 - 1. UserDetailsService
      - Interface used to load user-specific data during the authentication process.
        Implementations of UserDetailsService retrieve user details (such as username, password, and authorities(roles)) from a data source (e.g., a database , memory) and create a UserDetails object
      - The loadUserByUsername method is an implementation of the loadUserByUsername method defined in the UserDetailsService interface. This method is called by Spring Security when it needs to retrieve user   details for authentication.
      - When a user attempts to log in, they provide a username (or other unique identifier). The loadUserByUsername method is responsible for looking up the user in the user repository based on this provided      username.
      - If the user is not found in the database, the method logs an error and throws a UsernameNotFoundException. This exception is a standard exception in Spring Security and indicates that the requested  user was not found.
     
        ![UserDetailsService](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/b09d9e17-4047-486c-9c9c-9ac05efb4d6f)

 - 2. UserDetails
      - Interface Represents the principal (user) details, including username, password, and authorities. `Spring Security`   uses UserDetails to store information about the authenticated user.
      - GrantedAuthority Represents an authority granted to a user.
      - Authorities are typically roles or permissions that define what actions a user can perform.
      - Implementations include SimpleGrantedAuthority.
      ![UserDetails](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/ea3b7ecb-d6c3-4d10-81b9-6784e71dad93)


 
 - 3. PasswordEncoder
      Spring Security offers a range of password encoders to secure user passwords effectively. Letâ€™s explore these encoders to understand their strengths and limitations.
     
     - NoOpPasswordEncoder : 
         The `NoOpPasswordEncoder` is the simplest option, but it lacks any form of hashing, encoding, or encryption. It stores passwords in plain text, making it highly insecure for production applications. Avoid using this encoder due to its lack of security.

     - StandardPasswordEncoder:
        Deprecated and unsuitable for production, the `StandardPasswordEncoder` utilizes SHA-256 hashing with 1024 iterations and an 8-byte random salt. However, its susceptibility to modern attacks makes it an inadequate choice for safeguarding passwords.
     
     - Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder:
        The `Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder` employs the PBKDF2 algorithm, which stands for Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2. This algorithm enhances security through multiple iterations and a configurable salt. It's a better choice than the previous options, but there are more advanced alternatives available.
      
      - BcryptPasswordEncoder:
        The `BcryptPasswordEncoder` employs the bcrypt hashing algorithm, which has been in use since 1999. This algorithm is frequently updated to match modern computational advancements. Hashing with BcryptPasswordEncoder demands considerable CPU computations, making it resistant to rapid brute-force attacks. The time taken for hashing increases with the number of configured rounds, enhancing security.
      
      - ScryptPasswordEncoder:
        An evolution of the `BcryptPasswordEncoder`, the `ScryptPasswordEncoder` introduces additional security parameters: computational power and memory. This algorithm requires memory allocation, providing an added layer of security. Hackers attempting to crack passwords must also invest substantial computational power and memory resources.
        
      - Argon2PasswordEncoder: 
        The `Argon2PasswordEncoder` represents the latest advancement in hashing algorithms. It encompasses three dimensions: computational power, memory, and multiple threads (CPU cores). These dimensions collectively thwart brute-force attacks by significantly increasing the resources needed for each attempt.    
      
        In conclusion, when choosing a password encoder in Spring Security, itâ€™s crucial to consider the level of security required for your application. While some encoders, like `NoOpPasswordEncoder` and `StandardPasswordEncoder`, are inadequate due to their vulnerabilities, options such as `BcryptPasswordEncoder`, `ScryptPasswordEncoder`, and `Argon2PasswordEncoder` offer strong protection against modern hacking techniques. Carefully assess your application's security needs to select the most appropriate password encoder.
      
#### ok now you can use postman or any web browser to test , i use postman.

![authetication1](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/29365c55-b0a1-4736-90e1-e40cf5e59522)

##### ok go first to authorization and select basic authentication because default for spring security then set username and password and set endpoint then send , get `status : 200 OK` and return of endpoint appear in body.

#

#### let's try to change username or password then try.

![authentication2](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/2fb80b50-bec3-44ab-935e-a810e605998c)

##### oops , get `status : 401 unauthorized` because not vaild (Bad credentials) and not found in memory authentication.
##### If you use web browser get this page.

![Bad credentials](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/59f6b6a3-bd3f-4844-842e-e59fc88ab345)

#

#### also , you can see headers in postman , it looks as `name:value` as we said before.
![headers in postman](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/8e1568e2-aefd-49b9-84a1-3bcd4496e7fd)

## Chapter 4.

### Agenda 
  - **SecurityFilterChain**
  - **access EndPoint by Role**
  - **FormLogin**
  - **httpBasic**
  - **Customizer.withDefaults()**
  - **CSRF Attack**
  
#

   - 1. SecurityFilterChain
          ##### The `SecurityFilterChain` is a fundamental concept in Spring Security. It represents a chain of filters that are responsible for processing incoming requests and enforcing security measures within a Spring Security-enabled application. it plays a pivotal role in implementing robust security measures for web applications by enabling modular, customizable, and fine-grained security configuration.
   
          #
   
          ![Filter Chain](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/5ba20676-d68b-4608-9802-1688326e7320)
    
         - Filter Chain: Spring Security is based on a chain of filters, each responsible for a specific aspect of security, such as authentication, authorization, CSRF protection, etc. The SecurityFilterChain manages the order and execution of these filters.
    
         - Multiple Chains: In a Spring Security-enabled application, there can be multiple SecurityFilterChain instances. Each chain can have its own set of filters tailored to specific URL patterns or security requirements.

         - Ordering: The order of filter chains is significant. Spring Security evaluates the chains in the order they are defined and applies the first chain that matches the request. This allows for fine-grained control over the security configuration based on URL patterns or other criteria.

         - Customization: Developers can customize the SecurityFilterChain by defining their own set of filters or by configuring existing filters with specific parameters.

           ![Filter Chain And Memory Authentication](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/6824eb69-b5c5-4e72-b6a0-8463538d83c1)
     
   - 2. EndPoints:
          - `/api/v1/auth` : anybody(`user1`,`user2`, user3) can access to this endpoint don't needs authentication becuase i make to permitAll to access it. 
          - `/api/v1/auth/admin` : every one has role `ADMIN` can access to this endpoint like `user2 , user3`.
          - `/api/v1/auth/user` : every one has role `USER` can access to this endpoint like `user1 , user3`.
          - `/api/v1/auth/root` : anybody(`user1`,`user2`, user3) can access to this endpoint but needs to authentication becuase i don't permitAll like this endpoint `/api/v1/auth`.
          - if you login with `user1` that have roles `USER` then try to access this endpoint `/api/v1/auth/admin` you get next body in postman and by another way in web browser. 
           
            ![403 Forbidden](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/171352fb-4bd7-462f-8657-3bac8cf735ab)

   - 3. FormLogin
          - `formLogin(form -> form.permitAll())` this line permitAll user to access to login page if you don't set you get next page.
        
             ![Access denied](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/ad6521e9-4521-479e-8628-bf2bd97dad30) 
          -  If you don't like default security page was created by spring you can make one by html and css instead of and  in this line `formLogin(form -> form.permitAll())` replace by `formLogin(form -> form.loginPage("/login").permitAll())`
   - 4. HttpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults()) : 
           - this line i used to do basic Authentication because i use postman to test and i need basic authentication to can access. you can delete it if use any web browser.
           - `Customizer.withDefaults()` : is a factory method provided by Spring Security to create a default customizer for configuring `HTTP Basic Authentication`. It's a convenient way to apply commonly used settings without  needing to specify them explicitly.
           - if you use `httpbasic` and try to delete  `formLogin(form -> form.permitAll())` when go in any web browser and try to access `protected endpoint` next photo appear.

             ![js login page](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/b3711498-c3ae-400b-8157-1a7113dae62f) 

             but you can't return to login or logout page. you must restart application and web browser to go again , so i do `httpbasic` and `formLogin(form -> form.permitAll())` to allow this all.

   - 5. http.build():
           - Builds the HttpSecurity configuration and returns the resulting SecurityFilterChain bean.         

#

#### if you noticed in all above project i use `GET` not any other action like `post , delete , put` why?.

###### ok to answer this question i talk about `CSRF Attacks` , Cross site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a user is logged in. CSRF are typically conducted using malicious social engineering, such as an email or link that tricks the victim into sending a forged request to a server. As the unsuspecting user is authenticated by their application at the time of the attack, itâ€™s impossible to distinguish a legitimate request from a forged one, but in my application i will set csrf disbale by `csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())` if you need to make any actions like `post , put` but this is not always true becuase there other system needs it. so , this decision depends on the system if you need it or not . also you can see this video in youtube `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PHddMkl-yw` to understand it better , it shows how to hack using CSRF and what methods can solve it. 

  ![CSRF Attack](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/06f88106-26e4-4890-97c3-17ea093c7bb6)

#

   - 1. Authentication Manager (Interface):
         - Responsible for authenticating a user based on their credentials.
         - Spring Security uses AuthenticationManager to authenticate the user during the login process.
         - The default implementation is ProviderManager, which delegates to a list of AuthenticationProvider instances.
            - 1. AuthenticationConfiguration:
                This is provided as an argument to the method. It is presumably an instance of Spring's `AuthenticationConfiguration` class, which is used to configure the `AuthenticationManager`.
                `config.getAuthenticationManager()`: 
                This line retrieves the `AuthenticationManager` from the `AuthenticationConfiguration`. The getAuthenticationManager() method is presumably a method provided by the `AuthenticationConfiguration` class to obtain the configured `AuthenticationManager`.   
   
           ![AuthenticationManager](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/9af14e7b-e774-4dc5-b9a7-6d5a2bc20306)

   - 2.  AuthenticationProvider:
          - Implementation of Authentication manager and can override the authenticate().
          - Custom authentication logic can be implemented by creating a class that implements the AuthenticationProvider interface.
          - Common implementations include DaoAuthenticationProvider (use in this Example) for database-backed authentication and JwtAuthenticationProvider for JWT-based authentication.
          - Need to provide UserDetaliService(Load the user from DB and set the UserDetails) and PasswordEncoder(Since password will be saved in DB after Encoding)for DaoAuthenticationProvider.
  
             - 1. DaoAuthenticationProvider:
                `DaoAuthenticationProvider` is typically used when you have a traditional username-password authentication system where user details are stored in a database.
             - 2. JwtAuthenticationProvider:
                `JwtAuthenticationProvider` , on the other hand, is used when you're implementing authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
         
            ![AuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/de4c5c13-8729-4644-b17b-5be648bb8de2)

   - 3. AuthenticationEntryPoint:
         - When throw an exception like `UsernameNotFoundException` not throw because Spring Security work before anything then can't handle exception by this way , so `AuthenticationEntryPoint` come to fix it and help you to handle exception or i can say that exceptionHandling in security configuration that help me.
         - The `AuthenticationEntryPoint` interface in Spring Security is used to commence the authentication process when a user requests a secured HTTP resource without providing any credentials.
         - `HandlerExceptionResolver` is an interface in Spring MVC that allows you to define a strategy for handling exceptions thrown during the execution of handler methods (controllers) in your application.
         
           ![AuthenticationEntryPoint](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/6efb7eff-5673-4cc2-8c93-400dec3e6593)
   - 4. RestAdviceController:
        - A `@RestControllerAdvice` class in Spring is used to handle exceptions globally across multiple controllers. It allows you to centralize exception handling logic and apply it to all controllers in your application.
        - `@ExceptionHandler` annotation is used to declare methods that handle specific exceptions.
          The handleException method handles exceptions of type Exception. You can have multiple handler methods for different types of exceptions.

          ![RestAdviceController](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/668ea928-9705-4c8b-9909-c977ebf41982)
   - 5. Authority & Role:
         - Authority
             is an action that the user can do in your application `Read` , `Write` , `Delete` , `excute something`. it's usually represent by a verb.
         - Role
             is a badge that's usually represent by a subject like `ADMIN` , `MANAGER` , `CLIENT`.

           but technically speaking it's only one contract behind the scenes and it's GrantedAuthority in next picture.
           
           ![GrantedAuthority](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/6892b63e-f669-4f6b-9b5d-5f8ab600a193)
           
           so it doesn't matter if we dicuss about Authority or Roles it's still only one contract behind the scenes.
           Okay! To apply the Authority or Roles you can use `hasRole` , `hasAuthority` , `hasAnyRole` and `hasAnyAuthority`
           in **security configuration**. but there difference between them.
           
           - `hasRole`:
                This expression checks if the current authenticated principal has the specified role. Roles in Spring Security are typically represented as strings prefixed with "ROLE_" by default (although this prefix can be customized).
           - `hasAuthority`: 
                This expression checks if the current authenticated principal (user) has the specified authority. Authorities in Spring Security are typically represented as strings, and they can represent fine-grained permissions or privileges.
           - `hasAnyRole`:
              is like `hasRole` but can accept more than one role.
           - `hasAnyAuthority`:
              is like `hasAuthority` but can accept more than one Authority.
        
        Also , you can use `@PreAuthorize` or `@PostAuthorize` on **controllers** to apply roles and authorities but you must put `@EnableMethodSecurity` in to apply this. there difference between them.
           - `@PreAuthorize`:
              is used to specify access control rules that are evaluated before the method is invoked, and If the pre-authorization check fails `(i.e., the expression evaluates to false)`, the method is not executed, and an `AccessDeniedException` is thrown.
           - `@PostAuthorize`:
              is used to specify access control rules that are evaluated after the method has been invoked and before the result is returned to the caller , and If the post-authorization check fails `(i.e., the expression evaluates to false)`, an `AccessDeniedException` is thrown after the method has been executed, and the result is discarded.
           
        **now , you may be asking yourself the question should i use Role or Authority ?**
        ***it depends on the system , it's not mandatory***  
           
           **You will see that clearly when we apply it practically.**
   - 6. MySQL Database:

         - entites : `users`  , `roles` , `authorities`.
         - relations : `users_roels` , `roles_authorities` -> -*ManyToMany*-.
        
         ![MySQL Database1](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/f4a68c24-e5aa-443a-b54c-2d263a1a1a8a)
         
         - to connect to database open `application.properties` and this

         - if you need to create database automatically replace first line by `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/[your_database_name]?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true`
         - `logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG` : used it to enable logging for `Spring Security`
         - `spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion=NON_NULL` : This is a Spring Boot property that configures the default inclusion criteria for Jackson when serializing Java objects to JSON. Jackson will exclude all properties that have null values from the JSON output.

   - 7. Custom Implementation UserDetails:

         - there are many repository implement this in entity but this is not good because broke the first principle of the `SOLID   Principle`. so i separate this in `SecurityUser` class.
         - `isAccountNonExpired` , `isAccountNonLocked` , `isCredentialsNonExpired` and `isEnabled` make all true now. 

         ![Custom ImplementationUserDetails](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/5f95c0be-ef14-4c61-b8a2-6a1445c40d77)
    
   - 8. Custom Implementation UserDetailService:
         
         - overrid function `loadUserByUsername` i talk about this before.

           ![Custom UserDetialService](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/1ba604d4-b664-4ee5-ad2d-7169b249c364)

   - 9.  EndPoints:

          - `/api/v2/auth` , `/api/v1/auth/**`: permitAll to access don't need authentication and second endpoint means any endpoint under `/api/v1/auth` permitAll. 
          - `/api/v2/auth/admin`: need to `ADMIN` Role to access.
          - `/api/v2/auth/admin/write`: need to `ADMIN_WRITE` Authority to access but don't need to `ADMIN` Role ok there are difference between them.
          - `httpBasic`: is still basic Authentication but i add authenticationEntryPoint to handle authentication exception ,but there is a difference that you may not notice, which is that use any web browser and try to access `protected endpoint` you get login page to make authentication becuase i make this line `formLogin(form -> form.permitAll())` but if remove get always white page not contain anything , so i permit this to show login page in web browser.   
          - `exceptionHandling(ex -> ex.accessDeniedHandler(this.accessEntry))`: this line to handle access denied exception i make `CustomAccessDeniedHandler` to handle this you can see in repository.

          - `/api/v2/auth/user`: need to `USER` Role or `ADMIN` Role to access.
          - `/api/v2/auth/root`: need to `ADMIN` Role and `ADMIN_READ` Authority and `ADMIN_WRITE` Authority to access.  
          - `/api/v2/auth/subroot`: need to `ADMIN` Role and `ADMIN_READ` Authority or `ADMIN_WRITE` Authority to access.

   - 1. JWT:
    
        - JSON Web Token, commonly referred to as `JWT`, is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The token is digitally signed, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. JWTs are primarily used to authenticate users, authorize access to certain resources, and exchange information securely. you can see structure before use JWT and after.
        
          ![Structure Before And After](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/e5ae3899-64c8-4276-a94a-a4260d670052) 
        
        - now i want to see you how jwt work behind the scene.
         
           ![Structure Of Jwt](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/5344e5f9-2a96-470e-a023-968aa795f41f)
        
           A JWT consists of three parts separated by periods (.), which are base64url-encoded strings:
             
             - Header: The header typically consists of two parts â€” the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

               ![Header](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/a2d2f0fa-57f6-4da0-8505-abaa1df9143c) 
           
             - Payload: The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the user or other data. Claims can be of three types: registered, public, and private claims.

               ![Payload](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/69eb794b-515b-44f6-a9e3-7ec13bb0859e)
           
             - Signature: To create the signature part, you need to take the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, then sign that with the secret. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasnâ€™t changed along the way.
             
               ![Signature](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/aa762532-ed44-4f55-9789-76e9f855b903)
       
        - Pros of JWT:
         
            - Stateless: Since JWTs carry all the necessary information within themselves, the server doesnâ€™t need to maintain session information. This makes JWTs stateless, which reduces server load and simplifies scalability.
            - Compact and Efficient: Due to their compact size, JWTs are suitable for transmission over networks and are easily parsed by clients.
            - Security: JWTs are digitally signed, ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering. Using encryption algorithms enhances the security further.
            - Cross-Domain Communication: JWTs can be used across different domains or microservices since they donâ€™t rely on cookies or server-side sessions.
        
        - why you would want to use jwt?
   
            Let's take a look at a very simple example of one of the most common use cases of jwt here. We have two different servers. We have a bank that owns a server that runs all of their banking applications their banking website all the bank information. You could think of but they also own a separate server and this takes care of all of their retirement plans. They allow people to invest and do retirement plans on a completely separate rev application, but they want their users that log into the bank to also build to the automatically logged into the retirement account so when they switch from the bank to the retirement server. They don't want the user to have to re-log back in especially if they make this transition very seamless to the user so it looks like they're on the same application this is really common in a lot of larger scale Industries and applications and companies, so what happens is the client makes a request here to the bank. They say okay. I want some bank information bank information blah blah. They do all their banking stuff and then finally they get to the point where they actually want to access the retirement information and if you have a normal section based server what happens is your section is stored here inside of the bank and not inside of the retirement server so what happens is your user needs to log back in because they need to build their session stored on the retirement server because the session ID from the client is not found in the retirement server but when using jwt if you share the same secret key between both your bank and your retirement server then all you need to do is send the same jwt from the client to both of them and you'll be authenticated both times without having to read log back in. I know this is a little bit confusing to wrap your head around at first but essentially we're storing the user information on the quiet while in the old cookie session version we store it on the server and since we have two separate servers. We need to have the information stored on both of them, but that's not very easy to do or very possible, so I usually happens. Is you have to store it on one place and then the user has to re log in when they go to the other place but with jwt since the user information is stored in that token on the client. It doesn't matter if they access the bank server the retirement server or any other server that this bank owns. There's still going to be logged in because they have the same exact token and all the servers can recognize that token as long as they have that same secret key on the server another time that this is really useful same kind of example of multiple servers is let's say for example. We had two had two bank servers. The bank was very large and they needed two different servers to build a handle all of the users that were coming to the server and they have some form of load balancer out in front that distributed traffic to the different servers let's say that your client was accessing server a for a while and then this server it got really busy so it moved that client over to server B over here their session is no longer stored on server B it's only on server a so the user has to real aughh back in when this happens and with Jwt you don't have to worry about that because like I mentioned earlier the user stored on the client that's really the important thing about Jwt is the user is stored on the client so no matter how many different servers you have no matter how many different applications load balancers or anything that you have it doesn't matter if the user can always authenticate with any of those servers as long as you have the same secret key between them another instance where this really useful is just you have a lot of really small services such as micro services where you may have an API you may have an actual web server maybe even something else you can use that same jwt token from the client to authenticate with any of those different microservices all across your different architecture.
        
        - there are many type of tokens , In this repository i talk about access token and refresh token:      
  
             - `access token`: 
                  - you control access to your application's protected resources by using access tokens. Access tokens are the credentials representing the authorization given to an application. They contain the granted permissions in the form of scopes with a specific duration.
                  - In most cases, an access token should be short-lived, so your application reduces the time window risk of providing access to restricted resources when an access token is compromised.
                  In the scenario of an expiring access token, your application has two alternatives:
                      - Ask the users of your application to re-authenticate each time an access token expires.
                      - The authorization server automatically issues a new access token once it expires.
                  Depending on your applicationâ€™s needs - both options are valid. For example, you may ask your application users to re-authenticate each time a token expires for sensitive applications when the risk of damage is high if an access token is compromised. Using such an approach comes with a significant downside as this means you can't use it for applications that need offline access to protected resources; the end-user needs to be involved each time. 
                  - In this chapter i will focus on first way , Letâ€™s review how access token works in the context of your application by following this diagram:.
                      
                     ![Flow of access token](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/4f81f133-6f4e-4eff-8ba2-323d8a704969)

  
  - 2. Security Configuration:
       
       ![Security Configuration2](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/007ce092-835f-4259-ab31-3c9511a0c920)

      - 1. Session Management: 
      
         sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)): Sets the session creation policy to STATELESS. This means that the application won't create or use HTTP sessions for security.
      
      - 2. Authentication Provider: 
      
         used to determine any authentication provider used it (DaoAuthenticationProvider or any other implementation) that will be used for authentication. if you don't use custom implementation of AuthenticationProvider you can delete it.
      
      - 3. Jwt Authentication Filter:
         
         ![JwtAuthenticationFilter](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/da009764-e7c4-4713-a253-1539c7ba495b)
         
         - `addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)`: Adds a custom filter (authenticationJwTokenFilter()) before the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter. you can add filter by another ways like `addFilterAt` , `addFilterAfter` and `addFilter`. 
         `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`: This filter is responsible for processing JWT tokens and authenticating users. 
         may be ask me now why use `addFilterBefore`? Using addFilterBefore ensures that your JWT authentication filter is executed before other filters for several reasons:
            
           - Security Assurance: JWT authentication is typically one of the primary security measures in an application. By   placing it before other filters, you ensure that authentication is performed before any other security          concerns are addressed. This ensures that unauthorized requests are filtered out early in the process.

           - Efficiency: Placing the JWT authentication filter early in the filter chain can prevent unnecessary processing by other filters for unauthenticated requests. This can improve the efficiency of your application by avoiding unnecessary computation and database access for requests that will ultimately be rejected due to lack of authentication.

           - Ordering: Filters in Spring Security are executed in the order they are added to the filter chain. Using addFilterBefore allows you to explicitly control the order in which filters are executed, ensuring that JWT authentication is prioritized over other filters.

           - Avoiding Interference: Placing the JWT authentication filter before other filters reduces the risk of interference or conflicts with other filters. For example, if CSRF protection is applied before authentication, it might prevent requests with missing or invalid CSRF tokens from reaching the authentication filter, leading to authentication failures for legitimate requests.
         
         - 1. JwtService:
         
               The `JwtService` class is a component responsible for various operations related to JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in a Spring Boot application. It contains methods for generating, parsing, and validating JWT tokens. Letâ€™s go through each method and explain its purpose:
                   
                - `public String extractUsername(String token)`: 
                    This method takes a JWT token as input and extracts the subject (usually the username) from the tokenâ€™s claims. It uses the `extractClaim` method to extract the subject claim.
                - `public Date extractExpiration(String token)`:
                    This method extracts the expiration date from the JWT tokenâ€™s claims. Itâ€™s used to determine whether the token has expired or not.
                - `public <T> T extractClaim(String token, Function<Claims, T> claimsResolver)`:
                    This is a generic method used to extract a specific claim from the JWT tokenâ€™s claims. It takes a JWT token and a `Function` that specifies how to extract the desired claim (e.g., subject or expiration) and returns the extracted claim.
                - `private Claims extractAllClaims(String token)`:    
                    This method parses the JWT token and extracts all of its claims. It uses the `Jwts` builder to create a parser that is configured with the appropriate signing key and then extracts the tokenâ€™s claims.
                - `private Boolean isTokenExpired(String token)`:
                    This method checks whether a JWT token has expired by comparing the tokenâ€™s expiration date (obtained using `extractExpiration`) to the current date. If the token has expired, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
                - `public Boolean validateToken(String token, UserDetails userDetails)`:
                    This method is used to validate a JWT token. It first extracts the username from the token and then checks whether it matches the username of the provided `UserDetails` object. Additionally, it verifies whether the token has expired. If the token is valid, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
                - `public String GenerateToken(String username)`:
                    This method is used to generate a JWT token. It takes a username as input, creates a set of claims (e.g., subject, issued-at, expiration), and then builds a JWT token using the claims and the signing key. The resulting token is returned.
                - `private String buildToken(Map<String, Object> claims, String username)`:
                    This method is responsible for creating the JWT token. It uses the `Jwts` builder to specify the claims, subject, issue date, expiration date, and the signing key. The token is then signed and compacted to produce the final JWT token, which is returned.
                - `private Key getSignKey()`:
                    This method is used to obtain the signing key for JWT token creation and validation. It decodes the `SECRET` key, which is typically a Base64-encoded key, and converts it into a cryptographic key using the `Keys.hmacShaKeyFor` method.
                - The `SECRET` key appears to be a hard-coded secret key used for signing and verifying JWT tokens. Itâ€™s important to ensure the security of this key and to consider more secure methods for managing it, such as using environment variables or a dedicated secret management service in a production environment. you can generate by any tool on web like `https://keygen.io/#fakeLink` or from `JWT Generator`.
                - `jwtExpiration`: this important to make token expired after long time , even the user is to sign in each time enters the program.
        
        -  2. Bearer:

             A `Bearer Token` is a type of token used in the HTTP Authorization header `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to authenticate requests. The term "bearer" indicates that the token holder, or bearer, has access rights or permissions granted by the token.
    
        -  3. SecurityContextHolder:
         
             - Manages the security context, which holds the details of the current authentication and authorization information.
             - The SecurityContextHolder provides access to the SecurityContext, and the SecurityContext contains the principal (authenticated user) and their granted authorities.
             - We can set the authentication to Securitycontex at login and after JwtToken authenticated.
             
        -  4.  UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken:
          
            The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` is a class in Spring Security that represents an authentication token for username and password-based authentication. It implements the Authentication interface, which is the core interface representing an authenticated principal once the authentication process is completed.
            
  - 4. MySQL Database:
         
         - entites : `users`  , `roles` , `authorities`.
         - relations : `users_roels` , `roles_authorities` -> -*ManyToMany*-.

          - `security.jwt.secret-key`: refer to secret key in `jwtService` class you can change this name. also you can use the same secret-key `51f8bd5450122d34d6f895c98798923f0bcbf19285e92c477f8318272e017cbc` i'm used it. 
          - `security.jwt.expiration-time`: refer to Expiration time in `jwtService` class you can change this name also and make sure that expriration-time long. you can make `86400000`.
          
  - 5. Custom Login By RestController:
          
          ![Login Controller](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/13d57be8-8163-4a03-b526-7fd3c378fa23)
          
          ![Authentication Login](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/988decbb-f17a-4ed3-8049-37d18a7626bd)
          
          - i use dto design pattern apply this, i preferred it and use mapstruct to convert you can see in application to understand me better. 
          - `authenticationManager.authenticate(...)` is used to authenticate the user's credentials.
          - generate Token during login.
    
  - 6. Exceptions:
    
          i use RestAdviceController to handle exception and Authentication Entry point in security but may be notice that i use `try catch` and `HandlerExceptionResolver` in `JwtAuthenticationFilter` why? ok i used it because when try to access to protected endpoint by Invalid Signature `Bearer token` error throw in console before enter in filter before handle by exceptionHandling , then handle by `InsufficientAuthenticationException` but this is false because suppose handle by `SignatureException` and if try to access by expire token handel also by `InsufficientAuthenticationException` to solve it i use handler exception resolver in `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.
    
  - 7. EndPoints
          
          i use postman to make it , if you want to make it by web browser you must make `custom login page` and permit in security Configuration.
          
          note : if user don't enter role i make it `ROLE_USER` by default.

   - 1. Refresh Token:

        - `Access tokens` with a limited lifespan will eventually expire, removing access to the protected resources needed by your application users. If your application's users need access beyond the lifespan of an access token, they can retrieve a new one using a `refresh token`. That's their single purpose; you can't use a `refresh token` to access protected resources. That's the access token's responsibility. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens have a longer lifespan.       
        
        - Letâ€™s review how refresh token works in the context of your application by following this diagram:
         
          ![Flow of Refresh Token](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/1f13e1de-22fe-4831-b6af-230397e04e95)
        
        - Refresh Token 
          
             ![Refresh Token](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/976a8484-a001-44a0-9227-812d814f9762)
             
             - `private String token`: This field stores some random string (UUID), which is a long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens.
             
             - `private Instant expiryDate`: This field represents the expiration date and time of the refresh token. It indicates when the refresh token will no longer be valid.
             
             - `private User user`: This field represents the user associated with the refresh token. It establishes a one-to-one relationship between a user and their refresh token. i use JsonIgnore to avoid overflow during request record `user`.
         
         - Refresh Token Service
          
           ![Refresh Token Service](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/1f49859c-f55d-4780-a011-b9eb893325a9)
          
           - createRefreshToken : 
              This method is used to create a new refresh token for a user. It takes the username as input, fetches the associated user information from the UserRepository, generates a random token using UUID.randomUUID().toString(), and sets the expiration date to 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds) from the current time. It then builds a RefreshToken object and saves it to the database using the refreshTokenRepository.save(refreshToken) method. The newly created refresh token is returned.   
           
           - findByToken :
              This method is used to find a refresh token by its token value. It takes a token as input and queries the database using the refreshTokenRepository.findByToken(token) method. The result is returned as an Optional to handle the possibility of a token not being found.   
          
           - verifyExpiration : 
              This method checks if a refresh token has expired. It takes a token as input and compares its expiration date with the current time (obtained through Instant.now()). If the expiration date is in the past, it means the token has expired.
              If the token is expired, it is deleted from the database using refreshTokenRepository.delete(token), and a RuntimeException is thrown to indicate that the refresh token has expired.If the token is still valid, it is returned as-is.       
 
 

   - 2. MySQL Database:
    
        ![MySQL Database3](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/84202843-f381-425a-8313-9549daf1dfb8)
        
         also i set expire time for refresh token in for 10 days `application.properties`.
        
        ![application.properties3](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringSecurity/assets/105994948/55c1978f-5ccd-4221-89c2-c6f6fe7e6a71) 
   
   - 3. Exceptions:
   
         i add custom exceptions in application `NotFoundRefreshTokenException` , `RefreshTokenExpiredException` and handle by `RestAdviceController`  
   
   - 4. EndPoints:
